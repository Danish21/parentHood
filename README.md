# meanstarterkit
A Mean Stack Starter kit with passport js login authentication

I orginally created this kit to quickly create a mean stack web app to quickly launch an application that supports login so I can quickly focus on the main features of the web app. Open sourcing if is of use to anyone else or if anyone wants to learn from it.

Usage:

1) install homebrew (if you do not already have it)

2) brew install node (if you do not already have it)

3) brew install mongodb (if you do not already have it)

4) git clone https://github.com/Danish21/meanstarterkit.git localfoldername

5) cd localfoldername

6) npm install

7) cd web 

8) bower install

9) cd ..

10) sudo mongod &

11) node server.js

12) Go to localhost:3000 in your browser
